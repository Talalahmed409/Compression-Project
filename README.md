## Algorithms Overview

### **Lossless Compression**

#### Run-Length Encoding (RLE)

- Simplifies repetitive data patterns.
- Encodes consecutive identical elements as a single value and count.
- Example: `AAAABBBCCDAA â†’ 4A3B2C1D2A`.

#### Huffman Encoding

- Constructs a binary tree based on character frequencies.
- Assigns shorter codes to frequent characters.
- Guarantees the shortest average code length for a given set of characters.

#### Arithmetic Encoding

- Represents an entire message as a single fractional value.
- Subdivides the range `[0, 1)` based on character probabilities.

### **Lossy Compression**

#### NU Scalar Quantization

- Utilizes the **LBG algorithm** to quantize data into fewer levels.
- Prioritizes data size reduction at the cost of minor quality loss.
